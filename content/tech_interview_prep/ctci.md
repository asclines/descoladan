###### [Back to Intro](#intro)

[Cracking The Coding Interview (CTCI)](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/) is a fantastic book that walks you through all aspects of technical interviews.

This book has been in my possession since I was an undergrad preparing for internship interviews back in 2015. I cannot recommend this book enough. 

The following section is a reading plan I gave for the sixth edition of this book. I'm not sure how different other editions are. I may revisit this section in the future and re-write it as these thoughts are from a couple years ago.



1. Section I "The Interview Process"
2. Section IV "Before the Interview". Take special note of the Preparation Map. Bookmark it. Use this as a guide for developing your timeline and strategies.
3. If you need to brush up on Big-O notation then checkout Section VI "Big O".
4. Section VII "Technical Questions" This section is crucial to make sure you develop the proper mindset towards approaching a technical question. 
5. Section IX is an excellent crash course of all the high level data structures you should be comfortable with. It doesn't go in-depth which is fine for most scenarios, but if your aspirations are one of the big tech companies, prop finance companies, or a company that likes to have incredibly difficult interview questions you will need to have more in depth knowledge of data structures. Section XI "Advanced Topics" is a good starting point for that.
6. Real quick, go ahead and re-read section VII "Technical Questions". You probably missed something. 
7. Now for the fun part, Section IX "Interview Questions". This is where a majority of my time with this book was spent. Go through Chapters 1-11 ("Data Structures" and  "Concepts & Algorithms") and make sure you are comfortable solving those problems. I've personally never heard of anyone doing bit manipulation, but pretty much anything is fair game. 
8. The interview questions under "Knowledge Based" I'd put less weight on as a whole. If your language of choice for technical interviews is one of the languages in that section, make sure you know the answers to all of those questions. Databases is a bit tricky. With the amount of variation in databases and whatnot, I wouldn't worry about these problems unless the role you are applying for lists these concepts in job description. 
9. For some additional practice, the Moderate problems are a good source. Consider the Hard problems an extra credit level of work. I say this because I don't recommend this book so much for extra problems to solve but as a way to help you find your data structure and algorithm weaknesses. Once you have those figured out (based on which problems you struggled with before) and have brushed up on the topics you can graduate from the problems in this book to the vast quantity of problems online at websites such as [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/).
