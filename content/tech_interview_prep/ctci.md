[Back to Intro](#intro)

[Cracking The Coding Interview (CTCI)](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/): A fantastic book that walks you through all aspects of technical interviews.

This book has been in my possession since I was an undergrad preparing for internship interviews back in 2015. I cannot recommend this book enough. 

TODO: Finish this section.
