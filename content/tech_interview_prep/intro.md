Hello! This section of descoladan.com is dedicated to preparing **you** for the dreaded software engineer technical interviews. If you are not interested in preparing for these type of interviews or are not sure what I am even talking about, this section is probably not what you are looking for.


Within this section I have gathered a collection of thoughts stemming from my experiences with technical interviews and preparing for them. I have interviewed and received offers from big tech companies such as Apple, Amazon and Google (my current employer) in addition to several smaller companies. Additionally, I have spent the last couple years acting as a technical interviewer for Google. Here is what I have learned.
