[Back to Intro](#intro)


Once you have digested [CTCI](#ctci) and gone through most of problems in that book all that's left is to continue practicing and refining your skills. LeetCode is a website containing tons of technical problems you can work on. You write solutions in one of the many languages it supports and submit it whereupon LeetCode runs your solution against many test cases to catch any edge cases and performance concerns in your solution.

WARNING: LeetCode can be dangerous to your mental health if "abused". You can get lost within this site and lose track of your objective. So let me remind you now, your objective should not be the best on LeetCode. You don't need to be able to solve every problem on this website. There are some really hard problems on LeetCode. Problems not meant to be solved in the same time or manner as a technical interview problem. 

People competing on LeetCode come up with some convoluted solutions that maximize space/time on a problem while sacrificing readability and other good code practices. 

What someone using LeetCode for interview prep needs to do is:
* Limit yourself to problems that are of the same caliber as a technical interview (typically medium and some hard problems)
* Write clean, readable solutions (comments don't hurt)
* Limit time spent on this problem to being less than an hour (typical interviews won't go past an hour)
* Within the above limits aim for best space/time complexities


TODO: Provide list of good LC questions.
