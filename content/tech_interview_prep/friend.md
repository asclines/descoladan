###### [Back to Intro](#intro)

It's always good to surround yourself with people striving towards the same goal as you. First they help hold you accountable in practice and with motivation. Second, a great strategy you can employ is to take turns facilitating interviews with each other;either with a whiteboard or virtually. It is important that the interviewer give the interviewee a question the interviewee has not seen before. Thus the interviewee can practice working out a new problem in front of someone. 

It is important that interviewer properly run this interview. This entails:

* Choosing a question that should be solvable within 45 minutes.
* Understanding the problem and possible solutions well enough to be able to guide the interviewee with hints and whatnot when they get stuck or go the wrong direction. This is the hard part. Of course, you are not expected to be perfect at this.
* Asking follow ups to the interviewee such as "what is space/time complexities?". 
* Checking for edge cases and bugs in the solution. If a interviewee's solution is missing an edge cases I first ask "do you see any edge cases missing?" and if they don't answer I then give the edge case and have them walk through their solution with that example. This helps them uncover their mistakes.
* Keeping track of time. It's okay if the interviewee doesn't finish in time, it's practice after all. But they need to practice timing and not taking it for granted.
